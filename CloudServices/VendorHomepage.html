                Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which
                software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS
                is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
                SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, 
                including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software,
                 etc. Salesforce is an example of an SaaS.

                Platforms as a Service (PaaS) are cloud computing services that provide a platform
                allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity
                of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing
                and launching an app. Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment
                (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code in your browser. You can work
                on projects from your office, home, or anywhere using the internet.
