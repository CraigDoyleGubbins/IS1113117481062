                  <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which
                    software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS
                    is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
                    SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, 
                    including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software,
                     etc. Salesforce is an example of a leading provider of SaaS.</p>

                    with developing and launching an app. They let you work on projects from your 
                    office, home, or anywhere using the internet. Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE that

                    having to buy, manage and support the required infrastructure. This is an
