                Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which
                software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS
                is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
                SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, 
                including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software,
                 etc. Salesforce is an example of a leading provider of SaaS.

                Platforms as a Service (PaaS) are cloud computing services that provide a 
                platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the
                complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated 
                with developing and launching an app. They let you work on projects from your 
                office, home, or anywhere using the internet. Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE that
                lets you write, run, and debug your code in your browser.

                Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS) are online services that provide infrastructure
                like physical computing resources, scaling, security, backup etc. to customers who
                find it is easier, faster and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without
                having to buy, manage and support the required infrastructure. This is an 
                effective model for workloads that are temporary, experimental or that change 
                unexpectedly. AWS is a dominant Iaas provider.

                Communications as a Service (CaaS) is a collection of different vendor services 
                that facilitate business communications. As with other cloud services, organizations 
                may use these services to lower costs and increase efficiency for business 
                processes involving text, audio or video telecommunications, as the service provider 
                is responsible for the hardware and software management. Gmail is an example of a
                Caas provider.
