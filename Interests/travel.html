              <h2>Scouts</h2>
              <h3>USA, Summer, 2010</h3>
              <p>
                  During the summer of 2010, I went on a two week camping trip to the USA with
                  my local scout troop. Around 25 of us stayed in Camp John H. Ware 3rd in 
                  Pennsylvania. The camp was equipped with a shop, a dining hall, a swimming pool,
                  a shooting range and more.

                  We also went to Baltimore, visiting the national aquarium and other local attractions
                  around the harbour. At the end of our camp, we went to New York City and stayed
                  in a hostel for the last two days.

                  Since my visit to the USA, I've also been to Austria, London and the Isle of Man
                  with the scouts. These experiences have made me much more interested in travelling
                  the rest of the world.

              <p>
                  My 2nd year class in secondary school went on a week-long ski trip in Italy in 2013.
                  As there were around 100 of us, we were split into smaller groups according to skill.

              <p>
                Around the ski resort were many Italian shops selling clothes and food such as pizza.
                Everyone's skills improved over the course of the trip.
