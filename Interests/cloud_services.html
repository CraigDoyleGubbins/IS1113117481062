                <p>Snapchat is an Android and iOS social media application, where users send and recieve photographs
                that disappear soon after being viewed. Snap - Snapchat's parent company - has a $2-billion 5-year 
                contract with Google. This makes them Google's largest customer of their cloud platform. Snapchat 
                may be making use of Google's Cloud Storage, App Engine, Compute Engine, etc.</p>

                <h1>Facebook</h1> 
                <p>As the world's largest social media platform, with over 2 billion monthly active users and several
                mobile and web applications, it's easier for Facebook to have its own cloud servers. They have
                several datacenters in the US and one in Sweden. Here, they store photos, posts, conversations, etc
                and they mine data.</p>

                <h1>Netflix</h1> 
                <p>Netflix relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for all of its scalable computing and storage needs
                - their business logic, user analytics, recommendations, etc. that make up the Netflix application,
                along with their huge selection of on-demand movies and TV series. Netflix took 8 years to migrate
                to the cloud as they had to rebuild their systems in order to do so.</p>
