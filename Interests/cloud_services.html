                <h1>Netflix</h1> 
                <p>Netflix relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for all of its scalable computing and storage needs - their business logic, user analytics, recommendations, etc. that make up the Netflix application, along with their huge selection of on-demand movies and TV series. Netflix took 8 years to migrate to the cloud as they had to rebuild their systems in order to do so.</p>
