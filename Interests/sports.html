              <p>I joined St. Peter's Footbal Club, in 2002, when I was 9 years old. I 
              couldn't play that well for the first few years and so I never really got
              to play in matches with other teams, yet I stuck around. The friends I 
              made in the club made the sport much more enjoyable and they encouraged 
              me to greatly improve my skills.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In time, I made it to the A-team as a defender and won some championships
              with the team. I continued to play with St. Peter's until the end of 6th year,
              when I took time out to study.

              <p>My favourite football club has always been Barcelona FC. The club was 
              founded in 1899 in Barcelona and has since become a huge symbol of the Catalan
              culture - its motto is "M&eacute;s que un club", meaning "More than a club".</p>
